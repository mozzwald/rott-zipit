Rise of the Triad - Dingux Edition
==================================
Port tweaked by ingood

New options
===========
I've added two video modes for this port. The game can be displayed in regular 
320x200 vision or stretched, full screen mode. The stretched mode is nicer but
there is a performance hit.
I've adapted the "Fullscreen" option in the game menu (under EXT USER OPTIONS)
as a toggle between these two modes. The change will take place immediately and
will save on exit.

For Users
=========
You will need either the shareware or full version of ROTT. Simply extract this 
somewhere on your SD card. You'll need to put on of the following files in that same directory:
    rottsw - For shareware version (huntbgin.wad)
    rott - For full version (UNTESTED)

Also included is an icon for use in dmenu:
    rott.png

And here's some example dmenu.cfg code:
    MenuItem ROTT
    {                    
        Icon = "res/games/rott.png"
        Name = "Rise of the Triad"                   
        Executable = "./rottsw"
        WorkDir = "/usr/local/rott"
    }

NOTE: You'll need to make sure that $HOME is writeable. For the moment this means
running something like this before dmenu or rott is run.  For this example 
you'll need to have a folder called "home" on your SD card.
export HOME=/boot/home


For Developers - How to compile
===============================
First you'll need to change the SDK_DIR variable in the Makefile to match
the /usr directory of the toolchain. e.g. /opt/dingoo/usr

If you want to compile the Shareware version you'll need to change some #defines
in develop.h:

For shareware:
#define SHAREWARE 1
#define SUPERROTT 0

For full version:
#define SHAREWARE 0
#define SUPERROTT 1

Todo
====
  - Add MIDI playback support (is timidity feasible with such limited power?)
  - Tweak performance of fullscreen mode
